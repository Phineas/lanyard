# üè∑Ô∏è Expose your Discord presence and activities to a RESTful API and WebSocket in less than 10 seconds

Lanyard is a service that makes it super easy to export your live Discord presence to an API endpoint (`api.lanyard.rest/v1/users/:your_id`) and to a WebSocket (see below) for you to use wherever you want - for example, I use this to display what I'm listening to on Spotify on my personal website.

You can use Lanyard's API without deploying anything yourself - but if you want to self host it, you have the option to, though it'll require a tiny bit of configuration.

## Get started in < 10 seconds

Just [join this Discord server](https://discord.gg/UrXF2cfJ7F) and your presence will start showing up when you `GET api.lanyard.rest/v1/users/:your_id`. It's that easy.

## Socket Docs

The websocket is available at `wss://api.lanyard.rest/socket`. If you would like to use compression, please specify `?compression=zlib_json` at the end of the URL.

Once connected, you will receive Opcode 1: Hello which will contain heartbeat_interval in the data field. You should set a repeating interval for the time specified in heartbeat_interval which should send Opcode 3: Heartbeat on the interval.

You should send `Opcode 2: Initialize` immediately after receiving Opcode 1.

Example of `Opcode 2: Initialize`:

```js
{
  op: 2,
  d: {
    // subscribe_to_ids should be an array of user IDs you want to subscribe to presences from
    // if Lanyard doesn't monitor an ID specified, it won't be included in INIT_STATE
    subscribe_to_ids: ["94490510688792576"]
  }
}
```

#### Subscribing to multiple user presences

To subscribe to multiple presences, send `subscribe_to_ids` in the data object with a `string[]` list of user IDs to subscribe to. Then, INIT_STATE's data object will contain a user_id->presence map. You can find examples below.

#### Subscribing to a single user presence

If you just want to subscribe to one user, you can send `subscribe_to_id` instead with a string of a single user ID to subscribe to. Then, the INIT_STATE's data will just contain the presence object for the user you've subscribed to instead of a user_id->presence map.

#### Subscribing to every user presence

If you want to subscribe to every presence being monitored by Lanyard, you can specify `subscribe_to_all` with (bool) `true` in the data object, and you will then receive a user_id->presence map with every user presence in INIT_STATE, and their respective PRESENCE_UPDATES when they happen.


Once Op 2 is sent, you should immediately receive an `INIT_STATE` event payload if connected successfully. If not, you will be disconnected with an error (see below).

### List of Opcodes

| Opcode | Name       | Description                                                                                                                 | Client Send/Recv |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 0      | Event      | This is the default opcode when receiving core events from Lanyard, like `INIT_STATE`                                       | Receive          |
| 1      | Hello      | Lanyard sends this when clients initially connect, and it includes the heartbeat interval                                   | Receive Only     |
| 2      | Initialize | This is what the client sends when receiving Opcode 1 from Lanyard - it should contain an array of user IDs to subscribe to | Send only        |
| 3      | Heartbeat  | Clients should send Opcode 3 every 30 seconds (or whatever the Hello Opcode says to heartbeat at)                           | Send only        |

### Events

Events are received on `Opcode 0: Event` - the event type will be part of the root message object under the `t` key.

#### Example Event Message Objects

#### `INIT_STATE`

```js
{
  op: 0,
  seq: 1,
  t: "INIT_STATE",
  d: {
    "94490510688792576": {
      // Full Lanyard presence (see API docs above for example)
    }
  }
}
```

#### `PRESENCE_UPDATE`

```js
{
  op: 0,
  seq: 2,
  t: "PRESENCE_UPDATE",
  d: {
    // Full Lanyard presence and an extra "user_id" field
  }
}
```

### Error Codes

Lanyard can disconnect clients for multiple reasons, usually to do with messages being badly formatted. Please refer to your WebSocket client to see how you should handle errors - they do not get received as regular messages.

#### Types of Errors

| Name                   | Code | Data             |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| Invalid/Unknown Opcode | 4004 | `unknown_opcode` |
